Hello! This is my first project – the Hi-Lo game. It’s a simple yet fun guessing game where you try to guess a random number between 0 and 100. The game gives you hints whether your guess is too high or too low, and you have a limited number of attempts to get it right.

Game Flow:
Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between 0 and 100.

Attempts: The player is asked how many attempts they want to make to guess the number.

Guessing Process: The player makes guesses, and after each guess, the game tells them if their guess was too high or too low.

Victory Condition: If the player guesses the correct number within the allowed attempts, they win and are congratulated.

Game Over: If the player runs out of attempts without guessing correctly, the correct number is revealed, and the game ends.

Replay Option: The player can choose to play again by entering a specific command.

This game is great for testing your guessing skills, and it’s an enjoyable challenge to try and guess the correct number with the given clues. You can play as many rounds as you want and see how quickly you can guess the right number!
